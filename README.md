# Sorting Algorithms GUI

#### Hi! The reason I do this GUI app is to practice my python skills, I've practice some questions on leetcode.com, built a mp3 player through Tkinter package, and I'm studying data science. So I think it may be fun to build something from the knowledge I learned from these 3 fields. I used 4 sorting algorithms I learned on leetcode.com, Matplolib package I learned from my data science class to do animation of the sorting process, and Tkinter packages to build a GUI app that people can have UI to use it.


This wraped up my practice, hope it hlped you guys, thank you very much.
